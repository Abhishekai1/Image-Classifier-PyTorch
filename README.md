# Image-Classifier-PyTorch
The project aims to build an image classifier using the PyTorch deep learning framework. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits (0-9). The classifier employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to learn features from the images and make predictions.
